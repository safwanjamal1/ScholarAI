# Sharks

## Introduction
Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on each side of the head, and usually several rows of replaceable teeth. They are known for their predatory behaviors and play a crucial role in marine ecosystems.

## Classification
Sharks are classified into different species, with over 500 known species. They are divided into several orders and families, including:
- **Lamniformes** (great whites, makos, thresher sharks)
- **Carcharhiniformes** (bull sharks, tiger sharks)
- **Orectolobiformes** (whale sharks, carpet sharks)

## Habitat
Sharks are found in all oceanic environments, from shallow waters close to shore to the deep sea. Some species, like the bull shark, can also inhabit freshwater rivers and lakes.

## Behavior
Sharks exhibit a range of behaviors, including solitary hunting, schooling, and complex social interactions. They rely on their keen senses, especially their sense of smell, to detect prey.

## Conservation
Many shark species are threatened due to overfishing, habitat loss, and the demand for shark fins. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure their survival and the health of marine ecosystems.

## Conclusion
Understanding and protecting sharks is vital, as they are essential to oceanic health and biodiversity.
